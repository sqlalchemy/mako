0.1.1
- AST parsing fixes: fixed TryExcept identifier parsing
- removed textmate tmbundle from contrib and into separate SVN location; windows users
cant handle those files, setuptools not very good at "pruning" certain directories
- fix so that "cache_timeout" parameter is propigated
- fix to expression filters so that string conversion (actually unicode) properly 
occurs before filtering
- better error message when a lookup is attempted with a template that has no lookup
- implemented "module" attribute for namespace
- fix to code generation to correctly track multiple defs with the same name
- "directories" can be passed to TemplateLookup as a scalar in which case it gets
converted to a list [ticket:9]
