    If a template is opened with incompatible encoding (such as unicode text but
    no UTF-8 identification on PY2, or potential encoding mismatches on PY3),
    an exception such as UnicodeDecodeError will be raised that notes the
    offending character position - however no line is identified.

    This scenario will now return a `mako.exceptions.RuntimeException` which
    includes the exact line as debug information, alongside the original
    exception.
