### Caching

Any template or component can be cached using the `cache` argument to the `<%page>` or `<%def>` directives:

    <%page cache="true"/>
    
    template text
    
The above template, after being executed the first time, will store its content within a cache that by default is scoped within memory.  Subsequent calls to the template's `render()` method will return content directly from the cache.  When the `Template` object itself falls out of scope, its corresponding cache is garbage collected along with the template.

Caching requires that the `myghtyutils` package be installed on the system.

The cache flag can also be assigned to any `<%def>`:

    <%def name="mycomp" cache="true" cache_timeout="30" cache_type="memory">
        other text
    </%def>

Above, we also illustrate a few more options which are also available on the `<%page>` tag.

Cache arguments:

- cache="false|true" - turn caching on
- cache_timeout - number of seconds in which to invalidate the cached data
- cache_type - type of caching.  `memory`, `file`, `dbm`, or `memcached`.
- cache_key - the "key" used to uniquely identify this content in the cache.  it defaults to the name of the function (TODO: support for multiple defs with the same name).  It is an evaluable tag, so you can put a Python expression to calculate the value of the key on the fly.  For example, heres a page that caches any page which inherits from it, based on the filename of the calling template:
    
        <%page cache="true", cache_key="${self.filename}"/>
    
        ${next.body()}
