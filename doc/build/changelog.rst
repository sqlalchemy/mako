    :version: 1.1.6
    :include_notes_from: unreleased

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.1.5
    :released: Fri Aug 20 2021

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, tests
        :tickets: 338

        Fixed some issues with running the test suite which would be revealed by
        running tests in random order.



.. changelog::
    :version: 1.1.4
    :released: Thu Jan 14 2021

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k
        :tickets: 328

        Fixed Python deprecation issues related to module importing, as well as
        file access within the Lingua plugin, for deprecated APIs that began to
        emit warnings under Python 3.10.  Pull request courtesy Petr Viktorin.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.1.3
    :released: Fri May 29 2020

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, templates
        :tickets: 267

        The default template encoding is now utf-8.  Previously, the encoding was
        "ascii", which was standard throughout Python 2.   This allows that
        "magic encoding comment" for utf-8 templates is no longer required.


.. changelog::
    :version: 1.1.2
    :released: Sun Mar 1 2020

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, commands
        :tickets: 283

        Added --output-file argument to the Mako command line runner, which allows
        a specific output file to be selected.  Pull request courtesy Bj√∂rn
        Dahlgren.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.1.1
    :released: Mon Jan 20 2020

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k
        :tickets: 310

        Replaced usage of the long-superseded "parser.suite" module in the
        mako.util package for parsing the python magic encoding comment with the
        "ast.parse" function introduced many years ago in Python 2.5, as
        "parser.suite" is emitting deprecation warnings in Python 3.9.



    .. change::
        :tags: bug, ext
        :tickets: 304

        Added "babel" and "lingua" dependency entries to the setuptools entrypoints
        for the babel and lingua extensions, so that pkg_resources can check that
        these extra dependencies are available, raising an informative
        exception if not.  Pull request courtesy sinoroc.



.. changelog::
    :version: 1.1.0
    :released: Thu Aug 1 2019

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k, windows
        :tickets: 301

        Replaced usage of time.clock() on windows as well as time.time() elsewhere
        for microsecond timestamps with timeit.default_timer(), as time.clock() is
        being removed in Python 3.8.   Pull request courtesy Christoph Reiter.


    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k
        :tickets: 295

        Replaced usage of ``inspect.getfullargspec()`` with the vendored version
        used by SQLAlchemy, Alembic to avoid future deprecation warnings.  Also
        cleans up an additional version of the same function that's apparently
        been floating around for some time.


    .. change::
        :tags: changed, setup
        :tickets: 303

        Removed the "python setup.py test" feature in favor of a straight run of
        "tox".   Per Pypa / pytest developers, "setup.py" commands are in general
        headed towards deprecation in favor of tox.  The tox.ini script has been
        updated such that running "tox" with no arguments will perform a single run
        of the test suite against the default installed Python interpreter.

    .. change::
        :tags: changed, py3k, installer
        :tickets: 249

        Mako 1.1 now supports Python versions:

        * 2.7
        * 3.4 and higher

        This includes that setup.py no longer includes any conditionals, allowing
        for a pure Python wheel build, however this is not necessarily part of the
        Pypi release process as of yet.  The test suite also raises for Python
        deprecation warnings.

===

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.14
    :released: Sat Jul 20 2019

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, template

        The ``n`` filter is now supported in the ``<%page>`` tag.  This allows a
        template to omit the default expression filters throughout a whole
        template, for those cases where a template-wide filter needs to have
        default filtering disabled.  Pull request courtesy Martin von Gagern.

        .. seealso::

            :ref:`expression_filtering_nfilter`



    .. change::
        :tags: bug, exceptions

        Fixed issue where the correct file URI would not be shown in the
        template-formatted exception traceback if the template filename were not
        known.  Additionally fixes an issue where stale filenames would be
        displayed if a stack trace alternated between different templates.  Pull
        request courtesy Martin von Gagern.


.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.13
    :released: Mon Jul 1 2019

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, exceptions

        Improved the line-number tracking for source lines inside of Python  ``<%
        ... %>`` blocks, such that text- and HTML-formatted exception traces such
        as that of  :func:`.html_error_template` now report the correct source line
        inside the block, rather than the first line of the block itself.
        Exceptions in ``<%! ... %>`` blocks which get raised while loading the
        module are still not reported correctly, as these are handled before the
        Mako code is generated.  Pull request courtesy Martin von Gagern.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.12
    :released: Wed Jun 5 2019

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k
        :tickets: 296

        Fixed regression where import refactors in Mako 1.0.11 caused broken
        imports on Python 3.8.


.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.11
    :released: Fri May 31 2019

    .. change::
        :tags: changed

        Updated for additional project metadata in setup.py.   Additionally,
        the code has been reformatted using Black and zimports.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.10
    :released: Fri May 10 2019

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k
        :tickets: 293

     Added a default encoding of "utf-8" when the :class:`.RichTraceback`
     object retrieves Python source lines from a Python traceback; as these
     are bytes in Python 3 they need to be decoded so that they can be
     formatted in the template.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.9
    :released: Mon Apr 15 2019

    .. change::
        :tags: bug
        :tickets: 287

     Further corrected the previous fix for :ticket:`287` as it relied upon
     an attribute that is monkeypatched by Python's ``ast`` module for some
     reason, which fails if ``ast`` hasn't been imported; the correct
     attribute ``Constant.value`` is now used.   Also note the issue
     was mis-numbered in the previous changelog note.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.8
    :released: Wed Mar 20 2019
    :released: Wed Mar 20 2019

    .. change::
        :tags: bug
        :tickets: 287

     Fixed an element in the AST Python generator which changed
     for Python 3.8, causing expression generation to fail.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :tickets: 271

     Added ``--output-encoding`` flag to the mako-render script.
     Pull request courtesy lacsaP.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

     Removed unnecessary "usage" prefix from mako-render script.
     Pull request courtesy Hugo.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.7
    :released: Thu Jul 13 2017

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

     Changed the "print" in the mako-render command to
     sys.stdout.write(), avoiding the extra newline at the end
     of the template output.  Pull request courtesy
     Yves Chevallier.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.6
    :released: Wed Nov 9 2016

    .. change::
        :tags: feature

      Added new parameter :paramref:`.Template.include_error_handler` .
      This works like :paramref:`.Template.error_handler` but indicates the
      handler should take place when this template is included within another
      template via the ``<%include>`` tag.  Pull request courtesy
      Huayi Zhang.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.5
    :released: Wed Nov 2 2016

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

      Updated the Sphinx documentation builder to work with recent
      versions of Sphinx.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.4
    :released: Thu Mar 10 2016

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, test

      The default test runner is now py.test.  Running "python setup.py test"
      will make use of py.test instead of nose.  nose still works as a test
      runner as well, however.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, lexer
        :pullreq: github:19

      Major improvements to lexing of intricate Python sections which may
      contain complex backslash sequences, as well as support for the bitwise
      operator (e.g. pipe symbol) inside of expression sections distinct
      from the Mako "filter" operator, provided the operator is enclosed
      within parentheses or brackets.  Pull request courtesy Daniel Martin.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature

      Added new method :meth:`.Template.list_defs`.   Pull request courtesy
      Jonathan Vanasco.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.3
    :released: Tue Oct 27 2015

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, babel

      Fixed an issue where the Babel plugin would not handle a translation
      symbol that contained non-ascii characters.  Pull request courtesy
      Roman Imankulov.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.2
    :released: Wed Aug 26 2015

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, installation
        :tickets: 249

      The "universal wheel" marker is removed from setup.cfg, because
      our setup.py currently makes use of conditional dependencies.
      In :ticket:`249`, the discussion is ongoing on how to correct our
      setup.cfg / setup.py fully so that we can handle the per-version
      dependency changes while still maintaining optimal wheel settings,
      so this issue is not yet fully resolved.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k
        :tickets: 250

      Repair some calls within the ast module that no longer work on Python3.5;
      additionally replace the use of ``inspect.getargspec()`` under
      Python 3 (seems to be called from the TG plugin) to avoid deprecation
      warnings.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

      Update the Lingua translation extraction plugin to correctly
      handle templates mixing Python control statements (such as if,
      for and while) with template fragments. Pull request courtesy
      Laurent Daverio.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :tickets: 236

      Added ``STOP_RENDERING`` keyword for returning/exiting from a
      template early, which is a synonym for an empty string ``""``.
      Previously, the docs suggested a bare
      ``return``, but this could cause ``None`` to appear in the
      rendered template result.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.1
    :released: Thu Jan 22 2015

    .. change::
        :tags: feature

      Added support for Lingua, a translation extraction system as an
      alternative to Babel.  Pull request courtesy Wichert Akkerman.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k

      Modernized the examples/wsgi/run_wsgi.py file for Py3k.
      Pull requset courtesy Cody Taylor.

.. changelog::
    :version: 1.0.0
    :released: Sun Jun 8 2014

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py2k

      Improved the error re-raise operation when a custom
      :paramref:`.Template.error_handler` is used that does not handle
      the exception; the original stack trace etc. is now preserved.
      Pull request courtesy Manfred Haltner.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py2k, filters

      Added an html_escape filter that works in "non unicode" mode.
      Previously, when using ``disable_unicode=True``, the ``u`` filter
      would fail to handle non-ASCII bytes properly.  Pull request
      courtesy George Xie.

    .. change::
        :tags: general

      Compatibility changes; in order to modernize the codebase, Mako
      is now dropping support for Python 2.4 and Python 2.5 altogether.
      The source base is now targeted at Python 2.6 and forwards.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature

      Template modules now generate a JSON "metadata" structure at the bottom
      of the source file which includes parseable information about the
      templates' source file, encoding etc. as well as a mapping of module
      source lines to template lines, thus replacing the "# SOURCE LINE"
      markers throughout the source code.  The structure also indicates those
      lines that are explicitly not part of the template's source; the goal
      here is to allow better integration with coverage and other tools.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k

      Fixed bug in ``decode.<encoding>`` filter where a non-string object
      would not be correctly interpreted in Python 3.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug, py3k
        :tickets: 227

      Fixed bug in Python parsing logic which would fail on Python 3
      when a "try/except" targeted a tuple of exception types, rather
      than a single exception.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature

      mako-render is now implemented as a setuptools entrypoint script;
      a standalone mako.cmd.cmdline() callable is now available, and the
      system also uses argparse now instead of optparse.  Pull request
      courtesy Derek Harland.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature

      The mako-render script will now catch exceptions and run them
      into the text error handler, and exit with a non-zero exit code.
      Pull request courtesy Derek Harland.

    .. change::
        :tags: bug

      A rework of the mako-render script allows the script to run
      correctly when given a file pathname that is outside of the current
      directory, e.g. ``mako-render ../some_template.mako``.  In this case,
      the "template root" defaults to the directory in which the template
      is located, instead of ".".  The script also accepts a new argument
      ``--template-dir`` which can be specified multiple times to establish
      template lookup directories.  Standard input for templates also works
      now too.  Pull request courtesy Derek Harland.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature, py3k
        :pullreq: github:7

      Support is added for Python 3 "keyword only" arguments, as used in
      defs.  Pull request courtesy Eevee.

      Changed the format of the "source encoding" header output
      by the code generator to use the format ``# -*- coding:%s -*-``
      instead of ``# -*- encoding:%s -*-``; the former is more common
      and compatible with emacs.  Courtesy Martin Geisler.

    .. change::

      Fixed issue where an old lexer rule prevented a template line
      which looked like "#*" from being correctly parsed.

      The Context.locals_() method becomes a private underscored
      method, as this method has a specific internal use. The purpose
      of Context.kwargs has been clarified, in that it only delivers
      top level keyword arguments originally passed to template.render().

        :tickets:

      Fixed the babel plugin to properly interpret ${} sections
      inside of a "call" tag, i.e. <%self:some_tag attr="${_('foo')}"/>.
      Code that's subject to babel escapes in here needs to be
      specified as a Python expression, not a literal.  This change
      is backwards incompatible vs. code that is relying upon a _('')
      translation to be working within a call tag.

    .. change::

        :tickets:

      Template caching has been converted into a plugin
      system, whereby the usage of Beaker is just the
      default plugin.   Template and TemplateLookup
      now accept a string "cache_impl" parameter which
      refers to the name of a cache plugin, defaulting
      to the name 'beaker'.  New plugins can be
      registered as pkg_resources entrypoints under
      the group "mako.cache", or registered directly
      using mako.cache.register_plugin().  The
      core plugin is the mako.cache.CacheImpl
      class.

    .. change::
        :tags: feature
        :tickets:

      Added support for Beaker cache regions
      in templates.   Usage of regions should be considered
      as superseding the very obsolete idea of passing in
      backend options, timeouts, etc. within templates.

      The 'put' method on Cache is now

      The <%def>, <%block> and <%page> tags now accept

        :tickets:

      Template and TemplateLookup now accept an argument
      cache_args, which refers to a dictionary containing
      cache parameters.  The cache_dir, cache_url, cache_type,
      cache_timeout arguments are deprecated (will probably
      never be removed, however) and can be passed
      now as cache_args={'url':<some url>, 'type':'memcached',
      'timeout':50, 'dir':'/path/to/some/directory'}

      <%def name="foo()" filter="myfilter">
      then template.render(myfilter=some_callable)

      Added module_writer argument to Template,
      TemplateLookup, allows a callable to be passed which
      takes over the writing of the template's module source

      can be taken.

      The "benchmark" example is now Python 3 compatible
      (even though several of those old template libs aren't
      available on Py3K, so YMMV)

    :released: Wed Sep 28 2011

    .. change::

        :tickets: 174

      A Template is explicitly disallowed
      from having a url that normalizes to relative outside
      of the root.   That is, if the Lookup is based
      at /home/mytemplates, an include that would place
      the ultimate template at
      /home/mytemplates/../some_other_directory,
      i.e. outside of /home/mytemplates,
      is disallowed.   This usage was never intended
      despite the lack of an explicit check.
      The main issue this causes
      is that module files can be written outside
      of the module root (or raise an error, if file perms aren't
      set up), and can also lead to the same template being
      cached in the lookup under multiple, relative roots.
      TemplateLookup instead has always supported multiple
      file roots for this purpose.

    .. change::
        :tags:
        :tickets: 164

      New tag: <%block>.  A variant on <%def> that
      evaluates its contents in-place.
      Can be named or anonymous,
      the named version is intended for inheritance
      layouts where any given section can be
      surrounded by the <%block> tag in order for
      it to become overrideable by inheriting
      templates, without the need to specify a
      top-level <%def> plus explicit call.
      Modified scoping and argument rules as well as a
      more strictly enforced usage scheme make it ideal
      for this purpose without at all replacing most
      other things that defs are still good for.
      Lots of new docs.

      a table of escaped data
      (see http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2010/11/19/quick-mako-vs.-jinja-speed-test/).

      The FastEncodingBuffer is now used
      by default instead of cStringIO or StringIO,
      regardless of whether output_encoding
      is set to None or not.  FEB is faster than
      both.  Only StringIO allows bytestrings
      of unknown encoding to pass right
      through, however - while it is of course
      not recommended to send bytestrings of unknown
      encoding to the output stream, this
      mode of usage can be re-enabled by
      setting the flag bytestring_passthrough
      to True.

    .. change::
        :tags:
        :tickets:

      disable_unicode mode requires that
      output_encoding be set to None - it also
      forces the bytestring_passthrough flag
      to True.

    .. change::

      the <%namespace> tag raises an error
      if the 'template' and 'module' attributes
      are specified at the same time in
      one tag.  A different class is used
      for each case which allows a reduction in
      runtime conditional logic and function
      call overhead.

      Beaker is now part of "extras" in

      The Beaker import (or attempt thereof)

      New flag on Template, TemplateLookup -
      strict_undefined=True, will cause

      raise a NameError immediately, instead of
      defaulting to the UNDEFINED value.

    .. change::
        :tags:
        :tickets:

      The range of Python identifiers that
      are considered "undefined", meaning they
      are pulled from the context, has been
      trimmed back to not include variables
      declared inside of expressions (i.e. from
      list comprehensions), as well as
      in the argument list of lambdas.  This
      to better support the strict_undefined
      feature.  The change should be
      fully backwards-compatible but involved
      a little bit of tinkering in the AST code,
      which hadn't really been touched for
      a couple of years, just FYI.

      When Mako creates subdirectories in which
      to store templates, it uses the more
      permissive mode of 0775 instead of 0750,

      scenarios. Note that the mode is always
      subject to the restrictions of the existing

      the <%namespacename:defname> syntax described at
      http://techspot.zzzeek.org/?p=28 has now
      been added as a built in syntax, and is recommended
      as a more modern syntax versus <%call expr="expression">.
      The %call tag itself will always remain,
      with <%namespacename:defname> presenting a more HTML-like
      alternative to calling defs, both plain and
      nested.  Many examples of the new syntax are in the

      cache module now uses Beaker's CacheManager

      added "cache_enabled=True" flag to Template,

      For cache changes to work fully, Beaker 1.1 is required.
      1.0.1 and up will work as well with the exception of
      cache expiry.  Note that Beaker 1.1 is **required**
      for applications which use dynamically generated keys,
      since previous versions will permanently store state in memory
      for each individual key, thus consuming all available
      memory for an arbitrarily large number of distinct

    .. change::

        :tickets: 77

      added "bytestring passthru" mode, via
      `disable_unicode=True` argument passed to Template or
      TemplateLookup. All unicode-awareness and filtering is
      turned off, and template modules are generated with
      the appropriate magic encoding comment. In this mode,
      template expressions can only receive raw bytestrings
      or Unicode objects which represent straight ASCII, and
      render_unicode() may not be used if multibyte
      characters are present. When enabled, speed
      improvement around 10-20%. (courtesy
      anonymous guest)

    .. change::

      New Features, API changes:

    .. change::

        :tickets: 62

      added "attr" accessor to namespaces. Returns
      attributes configured as module level attributes, i.e.
      within <%! %> sections.  i.e.::

        # somefile.html
        <%!
            foo = 27
        %>

        # some other template
        <%namespace name="myns" file="somefile.html"/>
        ${myns.attr.foo}

      The slight backwards incompatibility here is, you
      can't have namespace defs named "attr" since the
      "attr" descriptor will occlude it.

    .. change::
        :tags:
